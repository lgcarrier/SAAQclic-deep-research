# Business Requirements for a Comprehensive SAAQ Digital Service Platform

This document outlines the core business requirements for a fully digital and efficient service platform for the Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ). It covers all customer-facing services and the internal operational capabilities needed to support them. The focus is on delivering a unified online system that streamlines **driver licensing**, **vehicle registration**, **road safety enforcement**, **insurance claims**, and **customer support** services, while ensuring integration with internal processes, payment systems, and regulatory compliance.

## 1. Driver Licensing Services

- **New Driver Applications**: Provide an online application process for new drivers to apply for a license. This includes a guided form to capture personal details and eligibility (age, residency, etc.), uploading required identity documents, and scheduling knowledge tests or learner’s permit issuance. The system should automatically verify applicant information where possible (e.g. cross-check identity) and create a digital applicant profile for tracking progress. Internally, applications should route to examiners or SAAQ agents for review and approval in a workflow, with the ability to schedule and record results of theory and road tests, and then issue a digital approval for license printing.

- **License Renewals and Upgrades**: Enable drivers to renew their licenses online, including paying renewal fees and updating any required information (such as taking a vision test or completing a questionnaire if applicable). The platform must support class upgrades or changes – for example, when a driver obtains a new class (like adding a motorcycle or commercial class), they should be able to apply or schedule the necessary test through the portal ([SAAQclic: New Online Services Available in February - The Car Guide](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/68591/saaqclic-new-online-services-available-in-january/#:~:text=It%20will%20be%20possible%20to,a%20plate%20or%20order%20a)). The system will handle class **re-classifications** (upgrades/downgrades) by verifying prerequisites (e.g. training courses or medical forms), scheduling exams if needed, and updating the digital license record once requirements are met. Confirmation of renewal or class change should be provided instantly, and a new digital license (or temporary license) issued until the physical card is delivered.

- **Address Changes and Personal Info Updates**: Allow users to update their address and personal information through their online account, with changes automatically applied to all relevant records (driver’s license, vehicle registration, and any SAAQ files). This **change of address** service should propagate updates across SAAQ systems to keep driver and vehicle records current ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=Image%3A%20icon%20%20Change%20of,Address)). Users will receive confirmation of the update, and if a new license or registration certificate is required (for example, if the address is printed on it), the system should trigger that process. Internally, the system should log address changes, update the central database, and notify any connected systems or external agencies as required by law.

- **Lost/Stolen/Damaged License Replacement**: Provide an online request service for replacing a lost, stolen, or damaged driver’s license. Users should be able to report a license as lost or stolen (to ensure it’s flagged as invalid) and request a replacement through the platform ([SAAQ launching new digital platform, 3-weeks no service during transition](https://montreal.citynews.ca/2023/01/23/saaq-new-digital-platform-3-weeks-no-service/#:~:text=The%20new%20SAAQclic%20platform%20will,from%20one%20name%20to%20another)). The system will collect necessary details (and an affidavit or declaration if legally needed), calculate any replacement fee, and process payment. A temporary proof of license (printable or digital) should be issued immediately. Internally, this triggers the card production system to mail a new license to the customer, and logs the old license as invalid to prevent fraud.

- **Road Test Scheduling and Management**: Integrate a scheduling system for driver examinations. Learner drivers or those adding a class should be able to book and modify appointments for knowledge tests and road tests online ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,Viewing%20or%20cancelling%20an%20appointment)). The platform should show available time slots and locations, allow rescheduling or cancellation within permitted timeframes, and send automated reminders (email/SMS) to reduce no-shows. Internally, examiners and office staff need an interface to manage the appointment calendar, set availability, and record test outcomes. Once a road test result is entered (pass/fail), the system should update the applicant’s status (e.g. prompt them to schedule a re-test if failed, or proceed to license issuance if passed).

- **International License Exchange**: Support the process for exchanging an out-of-province or international driver’s license for a Quebec license. The platform should guide users on required steps (e.g. uploading scans of their foreign licence, providing driving experience information, and scheduling an appointment for document verification and possibly a knowledge test). Users can book an appointment for **“driving experience acquired outside Québec”** to be recognized ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=Image%3A%20icon%20Appointments)). Internally, the system should flag these applications for specialized processing: verify the foreign license validity (possibly via an international database or manual inspection), schedule any required tests, and ensure an SAAQ agent reviews all documents at the in-person appointment before approval.

- **Driver Medical Fitness Evaluations**: Provide digital tools for managing required medical evaluations or declarations for drivers. Drivers who need periodic medical check-ups (due to age or health conditions) should be able to submit self-declaration forms online and have their doctors submit medical reports through a secure link. The platform will allow viewing one’s **“state of health”** info and submitting medical reports ([SAAQclic: New Online Services Available in February - The Car Guide](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/68591/saaqclic-new-online-services-available-in-january/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20drivers%20will%20be,declaration%2C%20medical%20record%20transmission%2C%20etc)). There should be an option to request an extension online if they cannot meet a submission deadline ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,of%20Health)). Internally, the system should track medical due dates for each driver, send reminders, and upon submission, route the medical information to SAAQ medical review staff. Decisions (fit to drive, restrictions, or required follow-ups) would be recorded, and the driver’s license status updated accordingly (e.g. adding a condition or suspension if not compliant).

## 2. Vehicle Registration and Management

- **New Vehicle Registration**: Facilitate online registration of newly acquired vehicles. Customers (or dealers on their behalf) should be able to register a vehicle by entering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), make/model, and other details, and by confirming ownership proof. The system will verify if the vehicle can be registered (not stolen or flagged) ([SAAQclic: New Online Services Available in February - The Car Guide](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/68591/saaqclic-new-online-services-available-in-january/#:~:text=It%20will%20be%20possible%20to,a%20vehicle%20can%20be%20registered)) and calculate the fees/taxes due. For dealer sales or new vehicles, dealers should have a dedicated portal to input sale details so that new owners can simply confirm and pay online. For private sales, the platform should guide both seller and buyer through a secure transfer process (possibly with each party approving the transfer in their own SAAQ online account) ([SAAQ launching new digital platform, 3-weeks no service during transition](https://montreal.citynews.ca/2023/01/23/saaq-new-digital-platform-3-weeks-no-service/#:~:text=The%20new%20SAAQclic%20platform%20will,from%20one%20name%20to%20another)). Internally, the system creates or updates the vehicle record in the registry, linking it to the new owner, and issues a digital registration certificate and new license plate number if needed.

- **Ownership Transfers (Sale of Vehicle)**: Provide a mechanism for transferring vehicle ownership between individuals digitally. The buyer and seller should be able to initiate a transfer request online, where the seller logs into their account to identify the vehicle and declare the sale, and the buyer confirms the purchase details. Both parties can digitally sign/accept the transfer. The platform should handle transfers of passenger vehicles online ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,a%20vehicle%20can%20be%20registered)) ([SAAQclic: New Online Services Available in February - The Car Guide](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/68591/saaqclic-new-online-services-available-in-january/#:~:text=Other%20convenient%20services%20include%20getting,a%20winter%20tire%20exemption%20certificate)), including calculating applicable sales tax or transfer fees. Once completed, the new owner receives an updated registration certificate and the system updates the motor vehicle registry. Internally, this process should also alert SAAQ agents if any anomalies arise (e.g., attempted transfer of a vehicle with unpaid fees or a car that is not roadworthy), so they can intervene. 

- **Registration Renewals (Plate Renewals)**: Support annual or periodic vehicle registration renewals through the platform. Users should be able to view their upcoming renewal(s) and pay the required fees entirely online ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,authorized%20debits)). The system will show the *vehicle registration payment notice* digitally ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=)) (instead of mail) and allow one-click payment to renew. Once paid, the vehicle’s registration status is updated immediately in the system (no sticker required, as Quebec uses a digital verification). Users can download or print their renewed **registration certificate** as needed ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,Replacing%20a%20licence%20plate)). Internally, the platform must update the valid registration period for the vehicle and record the payment. It should also generate any necessary proof of renewal and send an electronic receipt.

- **License Plate Issuance and Replacement**: Handle all plate-related services online. For a new registration or lost/stolen plate, the system should allow users to request a new license plate or a replacement plate. This includes assigning a plate number, taking payment for plate fees, and letting the user know how/when they will receive the physical plate. Users should also be able to **replace a plate** (if damaged) or **order a personalized (vanity) plate** through the portal ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,a%20vehicle%20can%20be%20registered)) ([SAAQclic: New Online Services Available in February - The Car Guide](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/68591/saaqclic-new-online-services-available-in-january/#:~:text=It%20will%20be%20possible%20to,a%20vehicle%20can%20be%20registered)). Personalized plate requests can include selecting a custom text (with automatic validation of availability and appropriateness) and paying the special fee. The platform will track the production and delivery status of plates. Internally, SAAQ staff should have tools to approve personalized plate text (ensuring it meets guidelines) and manage inventory of plate numbers. The system should mark old plates as inactive when replacements are issued, to prevent misuse.

- **Temporary and Special Permits**: Offer online issuance of temporary permits (e.g. temporary registration or transit permits for unregistered vehicles). Users can apply for temporary vehicle permits valid for short durations directly through the site, entering vehicle details and the reason (for example, to drive an unregistered vehicle to an inspection site). The system calculates the fee and issues a digital temporary permit that can be printed ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,Replacing%20a%20licence%20plate)) (with a QR code or identifier for law enforcement to verify). Additionally, support any specialized permits or exemptions, such as **winter tire exemptions** for eligible vehicles or seasons ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,a%20vehicle%20out%20of%20storage)). Internally, the system should record these permits in the vehicle’s record and their expiration, and make them visible to law enforcement queries to validate their legitimacy.

- **Vehicle Status Changes (Storage, Disposal)**: Allow vehicle owners to update the status of their vehicle, such as declaring it stored/not in use, or permanently disposing of it. Through the platform, an owner can put a vehicle **“in storage”** (which pauses insurance/registration fees) or **report it as discarded (scrapped)** ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,a%20passenger%20vehicle%20between%20individuals)) ([SAAQclic: New Online Services Available in February - The Car Guide](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/68591/saaqclic-new-online-services-available-in-january/#:~:text=Other%20convenient%20services%20include%20getting,a%20winter%20tire%20exemption%20certificate)). The system will update the registration status accordingly and adjust any fees (e.g. issue refunds for unused portion if applicable, or not charge renewal while in storage). When taking a vehicle out of storage, the owner can reactivate the registration online by paying fees due from the date of reactivation. Internally, this requires updating the vehicle’s status in the registry and notifying insurance components that coverage is suspended or resumed.

- **Vehicle Information and History**: Provide users with access to detailed information about their vehicles. In their account, they should see all vehicles registered to them with details like make, model, year, VIN, registration status, and expiry date ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,a%20vehicle%20out%20of%20storage)). They should also be able to request a vehicle’s **ownership history** (for a fee) showing past owners, or any liens/brands on the title ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,a%20vehicle%20out%20of%20storage)). The platform might integrate with an existing vehicle history service or SAAQ’s records to generate this report. Ensuring personal data compliance, ownership history for a vehicle can be provided when legitimate (e.g., the user owns the vehicle or has consent). Internally, this means the system can query historical registration databases and compile the report automatically for delivery via PDF.

- **Fee Calculation for Vehicle Services**: For all vehicle transactions (new registration, transfer, renewal, etc.), the system must automatically calculate fees and taxes. This includes registration fees, the insurance contribution (which in Quebec is part of registration), sales tax on transfers, plate fees, and any applicable discounts or penalties (such as late fees for overdue renewals). The platform should present a transparent breakdown of costs before the user confirms payment. Internal logic should incorporate rules (e.g., electric vehicles might have different fees, dealers might not pay PST on transfer, etc.) to ensure accurate fee calculation every time, feeding into the payment processing module (see section 7).

## 3. Road Safety and Enforcement

- **Driver Infraction Tracking & Demerit Points**: Maintain a centralized driving record for each driver that logs all traffic infractions, convictions, and demerit points. The platform must integrate with law enforcement and court systems to receive updates when a driver is found guilty of an offence, updating the driver’s record in near real-time. Drivers should be able to view their **demerit points, penalties, and offences** online through their account ([SAAQclic: New Online Services Available in February - The Car Guide](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/68591/saaqclic-new-online-services-available-in-january/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20drivers%20will%20be,declaration%2C%20medical%20record%20transmission%2C%20etc)), including the date and description of each infraction and the points associated. Internally, the system applies business rules of the demerit point system (e.g. points remain on record for a fixed period) and triggers automated consequences when thresholds are reached.

- **Points Management and Notifications**: The demerit point system should be fully managed by the platform. If a driver accumulates too many points, the system flags the need for a license suspension or intervention as per SAAQ regulations. Automated notices (e.g. warning letters or emails) should be generated when drivers approach the limit, and suspension notices when they exceed it. The platform can also allow drivers to **check the validity of their licence** at any time ([SAAQclic: New Online Services Available in February - The Car Guide](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/68591/saaqclic-new-online-services-available-in-january/#:~:text=It%20will%20be%20possible%20to,a%20plate%20or%20order%20a)) (which would reflect if it’s suspended or valid). Internally, upon points threshold breach, the system creates a case for suspension processing and ensures that any new transactions (like a renewal) are blocked until the issue is resolved.

- **License Suspensions and Reinstatements**: Digitize the process of suspending and reinstating driving privileges. When a suspension is mandated (due to demerit points, medical reasons, or a court order), the system should update the driver’s status and notify the driver of the suspension details (duration, reason, reinstatement conditions). The online portal should provide information on steps to get reinstated (e.g. after suspension period, paying a reinstatement fee, or completing a course). Once the conditions are met, drivers should be able to apply for reinstatement online, including paying any required fees and submitting proof of completion of conditions. Internally, the platform will maintain a **suspension calendar** and ensure no driving privileges are granted during the suspension period. It will also handle partial suspensions (like a specific class of license suspended) and automatically restore the license status when the criteria are fulfilled (or queue it for an agent’s review if manual approval is needed).

- **Monitoring Driving Restrictions (Interlock and Programs)**: Support the enforcement of specific driving restrictions such as alcohol ignition interlock programs or graduated licensing restrictions. For example, drivers required to have an ignition interlock device (breathalyzer) should be tracked in the system: the platform should record the requirement on the driver’s profile and possibly integrate with the interlock service provider to receive compliance data (e.g. installation confirmation, any violations recorded by the device). The system should also manage scheduling and tracking of mandatory remedial programs like the *Alcofrein* sessions for DUI offenders ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,test%20or%20an%20Alcofrein%20session)) – allowing those drivers to book their session online and confirming completion. Other restrictions, such as curfews or passenger limits for novice drivers, should be noted in the driver’s record so that any violation (if reported) can be processed. Internally, ensuring compliance might involve periodic checks (e.g. verifying interlock data) and coordination with external partners, with the system generating alerts if non-compliance is detected.

- **Traffic Violation Payments and Appeals**: Integrate the ability for users to pay traffic fines or penalties through the SAAQ platform, or seamlessly link them to the appropriate payment system. If legally permissible, the online account should show any outstanding fines related to the user’s driving record. Users could then pay these fines online, with the platform recording the payment and updating their record accordingly (which might be critical for allowing license renewal if fines must be paid first). In addition, provide information and online forms for those who wish to contest a ticket or appeal a SAAQ decision (like a license sanction). While the actual contestation of a traffic ticket usually happens through the court system, the SAAQ platform can guide users on how to file an appeal and perhaps allow them to submit a notice of contestation that can be forwarded to the courts. Internally, for appeals that are under SAAQ’s jurisdiction (such as appealing a decision on a claim or a medical-related license restriction), the system should log the appeal request, prevent any enforcement actions (like not processing a license revocation) while an appeal is pending, and track the outcome from the appeals committee or relevant authority.

## 4. Insurance and Claims Processing

- **Accident Claim Submission**: Enable individuals involved in traffic accidents to file compensation claims online. The platform should provide a step-by-step **accident claim** form where users (or their legal representatives) can report an accident and any injuries sustained. This includes capturing details of the event, the persons involved, police report information, and the nature of injuries or damages. The online service for **filing a claim for compensation** will allow claimants to initiate a claim for injury or death benefits entirely online ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,copy%20of%20a%20compensation%20file)). On submission, the system creates a claim case number and confirms receipt to the user, along with instructions for next steps. Internally, the claim is routed to the appropriate SAAQ claims office queue, where an adjuster is assigned. The system should perform initial validations (e.g., checking if a police report or hospital report is needed) and possibly cross-reference the driver’s license or vehicle involved to pull up relevant info automatically.

- **Document Upload and Claim Management**: Allow claimants to submit all required documents and follow-ups through a secure online interface. This includes uploading medical reports, receipts for expenses, and completing additional claim forms (such as a medical visit report or return-to-work report) online ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,copy%20of%20a%20compensation%20file)). The platform should have a **document submission** service for claims where users can attach supporting files, which are then linked to their claim record. Customers should also be able to view the status of their claim (e.g. “under review”, “additional info needed”, “approved - pending payment”) in real-time through their account. They should receive notifications or messages from SAAQ if more information is required. Internally, adjusters and SAAQ claims staff will use a claims management module that displays all submitted information, allows them to make notes, request more info (triggering a user notification), and update the claim status. All documents submitted should be stored in a content management system and flagged to the adjuster for review, reducing the need for mail. There should also be an audit trail of all communications between the adjuster and claimant for transparency.

- **Compensation Calculation and Payouts**: The system must support calculating compensation for approved claims and managing payments. This includes modules to calculate medical expense reimbursements, income replacement indemnities, rehabilitation costs, and lump-sum payouts according to SAAQ’s insurance rules. Once a claim is approved or a payment is due, the platform should schedule the payment (whether it’s a one-time payment or recurring monthly benefit). Payment information (amount, date issued, method) should be visible to the claimant in their account for transparency. Internally, this requires integration with SAAQ’s financial systems to issue payments (direct deposit or cheques). The system should ensure that payment calculations adhere to policy (e.g., percentage of salary for income replacement up to a maximum), and handle adjustments if, for example, a person returns to work (hence reducing benefits). A robust approval mechanism should exist so that any large or exceptional payments get managerial sign-off before disbursement.

- **Medical Assessments and Rehabilitation Support**: Support the end-to-end handling of medical evaluations within claims. If a claim requires an independent medical assessment (IME) or functional capacity evaluation, the platform should manage the referral process: scheduling the appointment with an external medical professional and notifying the claimant. Health care providers (doctors, physiotherapists, etc.) and other external partners should have a secure portal (or use the same platform with special access) to **transmit medical documents and invoices** related to a claim ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=Vous%20%C3%AAtes%20un%20professionnel%20de,demandes%20de%20remboursement%20en%20ligne)). For example, a doctor could upload a medical report directly to the claimant’s file, or a physiotherapist could submit a progress report and an invoice for services. The system should also handle requests for rehabilitation services or equipment, allowing providers to seek pre-authorization through the platform and the SAAQ agents to respond online. Internally, this implies integration between the claims management system and external provider access (with proper authentication for privacy). The platform should track all medical requirements and deadlines (e.g., schedule the next medical review, ensure the claimant attends required appointments) and escalate if missed.

- **Appeals and Dispute Resolution**: Provide a clear process for claimants to dispute a decision or file an appeal. Through the online account, a user who is not satisfied with a claims decision (denial or the amount of compensation) can submit an appeal request or ask for a second review. The system should collect the necessary information for an appeal and any additional supporting documents. It may also guide the user on the formal appeal channels (for instance, informing them about the **Administrative Tribunal of Québec** if it goes beyond SAAQ’s internal appeal). Internally, the platform would register the appeal, freeze any closures of the claim until the appeal is heard, and assign the case to an appeals officer or appropriate department. Status updates on the appeal (e.g., hearing scheduled, decision made) should be communicated to the user. Additionally, for minor disputes or clarifications, the system could facilitate direct communication between the claimant and a supervisor to potentially resolve issues without a formal appeal (this would be part of customer service, but tied into the claim record).

## 5. Customer Service and Support

- **Online Appointment Booking**: Provide a unified appointment scheduling system for any in-person services at SAAQ service centers. Customers should be able to book appointments online not only for driving exams (already covered) but also for other in-person needs such as submitting original documents, getting a photo taken for a license, vehicle inspections if required, or any service that requires a visit ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=Image%3A%20icon%20Appointments)). The booking system should show the user all available locations and times for the type of service they need, allow rescheduling or cancellation, and send reminders. Internally, branch office staff should have synchronized schedules and the ability to manage (add, move, or cancel) appointments. This reduces wait times and ensures a smoother in-person experience, aligning walk-in traffic with scheduled appointments.

- **Multi-Channel Customer Support**: Ensure the platform supports multiple customer service channels and that information is consistent across them. While the emphasis is on digital self-service, users who need help should have access to support via phone, email, or chat. The system should integrate a helpdesk/CRM module that records customer inquiries regardless of channel. For example, if a user calls the call center, the agent should be able to pull up the user’s profile and see their recent online activities or pending applications, to assist efficiently. Similarly, provide a secure messaging or live chat feature on the website for real-time support. All channels should use the same knowledge base so that the advice given is consistent. Notably, even with the new online services, **in-person and phone services remain available** and should be fully integrated ([SAAQ launching new digital platform, 3-weeks no service during transition](https://montreal.citynews.ca/2023/01/23/saaq-new-digital-platform-3-weeks-no-service/#:~:text=The%20new%20SAAQclic%20platform%20will,from%20one%20name%20to%20another)) – meaning any transaction done by an agent in person or by phone updates the same system that online users access. The requirement is an omnichannel experience: customers can start a process online and finish it in person (or vice versa) without duplication.

- **Real-Time Application Status Tracking**: For every service request or application a customer submits, the platform should provide real-time status updates. A personalized dashboard or timeline in the user’s account can show each active request (license application, vehicle transfer, claim, etc.) with its current status (e.g., “Under Review”, “Approved”, “Ready for pickup”, “Additional info required”). This transparency reduces uncertainty and calls to support. For example, if a user applied for a license renewal, they could see that payment is received and the new card is in production with an estimated mailing date. Or for a claim, they see it’s awaiting a medical report. The system should update these statuses automatically as internal staff move the case through steps. Internally, this means every workflow step in the back office should correspond to a status that can be exposed (in a user-friendly description) to the client. Also, notifications (email/SMS or in-app) should be sent when a status changes significantly (e.g., “Your claim has been approved – click here to see details.”).

- **Secure Document Upload & Verification**: Across all service categories, customers should have the ability to upload required documents securely through the platform. Whether it’s uploading proof of identity for a license, a proof of sale for vehicle transfer, or medical notes for a claim, the system should provide a secure upload interface that supports common file formats. Each upload should be tied to the specific transaction or record and stored in a secure document repository. The platform should perform basic verification on uploads (e.g., correct file type, possibly image clarity checks) and then mark the transaction as “documents received”. Internal users should have tools to view and verify these documents easily. To streamline processes, certain verification can be automated: for instance, reading a barcode on a document or using OCR to extract key fields. An audit trail of document submission and any approvals should be kept. This feature greatly reduces the need for mailing or physically presenting documents, speeding up processing times ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,copy%20of%20a%20compensation%20file)).

- **Notifications and Communications**: Implement a robust notification system to keep users informed. The platform should send confirmations for every transaction (e.g., a confirmation email for a renewal or an SMS for a scheduled appointment). It should also send reminders for important deadlines – for example, a reminder that a license or registration is about to expire, or that a medical report is due. Notifications can be delivered via email, SMS, and in-app messages, based on user preference. Additionally, provide a **“My Messages”** or correspondence center within the user’s account where all official communications from SAAQ are logged (including letters about fines, renewal notices, etc., many of which can be delivered electronically instead of paper ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=))). Internally, templates for these communications should be managed centrally to ensure clarity and compliance with language laws. The system should also allow two-way communication: users could reply to certain messages or send a query about a specific case, which would be directed to the relevant department’s queue, linking the communication to their file for context.

- **User-Friendly Interface and Self-Service Tools**: Ensure the customer-facing portal is intuitive and helps users navigate SAAQ’s sometimes complex processes. Provide guided wizards for complicated tasks (like first-time license application or filing a claim) that break down the steps and show progress. Include tooltips or an FAQ section contextually within each service page. The platform could also feature a virtual assistant or searchable knowledge base to answer common questions. For example, if a user is in the vehicle transfer section and is confused about a term, a help article or chatbot could clarify it. The requirement is to minimize user errors and drop-offs by making the digital platform as easy to use as possible, catering to users of all ages and technical backgrounds. Internally, gather analytics on where users face difficulties (e.g., form fields that are often left blank or pages where users abandon the process) so that the SAAQ can continually improve the user experience.

## 6. Internal Operational Needs

- **Integration with Law Enforcement and Courts**: The platform must seamlessly integrate with police and court information systems to both receive and send data relevant to SAAQ services. This means when a court registers a conviction for a traffic offense, the details (offense code, date, points, fines) are transmitted to SAAQ’s system electronically, updating the driver’s record without manual input. Similarly, if a driver’s license is suspended or reinstated by court order, that status update flows into the system. The SAAQ platform should also expose interfaces (APIs) for law enforcement to query license and vehicle information on-demand – for example, allowing police officers to check if a driver’s license is valid or if a vehicle is properly registered in real time. For unpaid fines or warrants, the system might receive flags from the justice system that could trigger holds on renewing licenses or vehicle registrations until resolved. All such integrations need to be secure, using encryption and logging access for privacy. This tight integration ensures that SAAQ’s data is always up-to-date with legal actions and that enforcement of regulations (like ensuring suspended drivers cannot renew) is automated.

- **Integration with Other Agencies and Partners**: Besides law enforcement, the SAAQ platform should connect with various governmental and private partners. This includes: the health care system (for validating medical fitness reports or receiving hospital notifications for serious accidents), other provincial and territorial licensing agencies (to exchange driving records when people move or to prevent someone banned in another province from immediately getting a Quebec license), and immigration or identity databases (to verify identity documents of newcomers). Additionally, provide dedicated digital access for **dealers, fleet managers, inspection stations, and other partners** who interact with SAAQ ([SAAQclic: New Online Services Available in February - The Car Guide](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/68591/saaqclic-new-online-services-available-in-january/#:~:text=Of%20course%2C%20SAAQclic%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20created,will%20have%20access%20to%20it)). For example, car dealerships should be able to register vehicles on behalf of customers via a B2B interface; heavy vehicle fleet operators might access their drivers’ sanction records or manage vehicle groupings through the system; vehicle inspection agents could input inspection results directly. Each of these external partners would have their own portal views and permissions within the platform, and the system must validate and segregate their access appropriately. These integrations reduce duplicate data entry and speed up inter-agency processes (for instance, instantly notifying the health insurance board of a license suspension for medical reasons, or receiving real-time verification from insurance companies that a vehicle has mandatory private insurance coverage).

- **Fraud Prevention and Identity Verification**: Implement strong identity verification measures to prevent fraud and ensure that only authorized individuals access or alter records. Upon first use, users must authenticate using the government’s trusted authentication service (e.g., the Québec Government Authentication Service) to verify their identity ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=Before%20you%20can%20access%20SAAQclic%2C,your%20Government%20Authentication%20Service%20account)). The platform may leverage digital ID verification (scanning an ID or using a provincial digital identity solution) to confirm a person’s identity when they sign up. For sensitive operations (like transferring a vehicle or requesting a large payment), consider multi-factor authentication or one-time confirmation codes. Internally, the system should have fraud detection rules – for example, flagging if an unusually high number of transactions come from one account or if there are multiple claims from the same person in a short time. It should also validate information against authoritative sources: e.g. verify a driver’s provided health number or other ID with the issuing authority for correctness. All data changes (address changes, name changes, etc.) should require either supporting documents or cross-checks to prevent identity theft. The system must maintain an audit log of all critical transactions and changes, which is crucial for forensic analysis in case of suspected fraud.

- **Automated Workflow Management**: The platform should include a workflow engine that automates the progression of service requests through various processing stages. Each type of transaction (license application, vehicle transfer, claim, etc.) will have defined workflows that may involve multiple steps and possibly different SAAQ departments. The system should automatically route tasks to the right personnel or team based on these workflows. For instance, a new driver’s license application might go through steps: document verification → knowledge test result check → await road test → final approval. The system will move the application along as each step is completed, without manual intervention to “send” it to the next step. If a step requires manual review (say an agent’s approval or an exception handling), that task appears in the appropriate employee’s task queue/dashboard. The platform should also allow management to configure business rules and workflow paths without heavy IT intervention (for flexibility when policies change). Escalation rules are needed as well (e.g., if a claim has been sitting with no action for too long, raise an alert to a supervisor). By automating workflows, the SAAQ can ensure faster processing times and fewer cases falling through the cracks, while also collecting data on processing durations for each step.

- **Employee Access Controls and Role Management**: Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) for internal users (employees and contractors). Given the sensitivity of the data, each staff member should have a user profile with roles that grant permissions only to the functions and data they require. For example, a customer service representative might have read-access to driver and vehicle records and the ability to update addresses or process payments, but cannot modify demerit points or approve claims. A claims adjuster can edit and approve claims but perhaps not access driving test scheduling. The system should support multiple roles per user if needed and allow managers to approve role assignments. There should also be an admin interface for managing roles and permissions centrally. **Audit trails** are critical: every view or change of a personal record by an employee should be logged (who accessed it, what was changed, when) to deter and detect any inappropriate access. Certain especially sensitive actions (like expunging a record, overriding a fee, or cancelling a ticket) might require dual approval or elevated privileges that only a few accounts have. These controls ensure compliance with privacy laws and maintain public trust in how their data is handled.

- **Performance Analytics and Service Optimization**: The platform should include reporting and analytics tools to help SAAQ monitor its performance and improve services. Key performance indicators (KPIs) like average processing time per service (e.g., how long a license renewal takes), number of transactions completed online vs in-person, system uptime, user satisfaction metrics (from feedback forms), etc., should be tracked. The system should gather statistics automatically – for instance, how many new applications were processed in a month, how many road tests are booked vs capacity, how many claims are filed and average payout times. A dashboard for SAAQ management can display these metrics in real-time. Additionally, analytics can help identify bottlenecks (e.g., if many users abandon a certain form page or if a particular office has slower processing). The requirement is that the platform supports exporting data and generating reports easily, with the ability to drill down into details as needed. This data-driven approach will enable continuous improvement of the digital services and allow SAAQ to allocate resources more effectively (like adding more exam slots if demand is high, or increasing server capacity if usage spikes).

- **Data Security and Privacy Compliance**: Although a technical consideration, from a business standpoint the platform must enforce all of SAAQ’s privacy and security policies. This includes ensuring personal information is encrypted in transit and at rest, backed up securely, and only retained as long as necessary according to record retention rules. There should be business rules for data retention – for example, how long to keep old driving records or closed claims – in compliance with Quebec laws. The system should also support responding to **access to information requests** or GDPR-like personal data requests easily by compiling the data related to an individual when needed. SAAQ’s operations require maintaining confidentiality of medical information and other sensitive data, so the business must require the system to have segregated data access (medical info only visible to authorized medical unit staff, for instance) and robust consent management for sharing info with third parties. Regular security audits and updates should be mandated to protect against cyber threats, given the critical nature of SAAQ data.

## 7. Payment Processing and Financial Transactions

- **Secure Online Payment Gateway**: Integrate a secure payment gateway to handle online financial transactions for all services. Users should be able to pay fees for driver’s licenses, vehicle registrations, fines, and other services through credit cards, debit cards, or direct bank payments in a **PCI-compliant** manner. The payment process must be seamless and embedded in the platform’s workflow (e.g., after filling a form, you’re prompted to pay if needed, then receive confirmation). Given the government context, the system could also support integrations with online banking (for instance, many Quebecers pay SAAQ bills via their bank; the platform should credit those payments when received). Each transaction should generate an **electronic receipt** that the user can download or receive by email, and the system should update the relevant records immediately upon successful payment (for example, marking a renewal as complete once payment is confirmed). Internally, the platform must ensure all transactions are encrypted and that no sensitive payment data is stored beyond what is necessary (tokenize card info if storing for future, etc.), adhering to security standards.

- **Automated Fee Calculation and Invoicing**: For any service that requires payment, the platform should automatically compute the amount due based on the latest fee schedules and the specifics of the transaction. This includes adding up base fees, taxes (GST/PST if applicable on certain transactions like sales tax on vehicle transfers), and any extras (like a contribution to insurance funds, or a fee per demerit point for certain penalties). If a user performs multiple services in one session (for example, renewing two vehicles and a license), the system could combine these into a single checkout for convenience, but still itemize each. The platform should generate invoices or payment notices digitally – for example, show the **driver’s licence or vehicle registration renewal notice** online instead of mail ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=)). It should also handle edge cases like pro-rated fees (if registering a vehicle late in the year) or refunds/credits if someone cancels a service. Internally, there must be a central fee table that is easy to update by authorized staff when fees change annually, and the system should apply the new fees from the effective date. The calculation logic should be thoroughly tested to avoid over or under-charging.

- **Pre-Authorized Payments and Installment Plans**: Offer convenient payment options such as pre-authorized debits or installment plans for those who qualify. For example, allow drivers to **simulate and set up pre-authorized debits** for their renewals ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,authorized%20debits)) – meaning instead of one annual lump sum, they can pay in monthly or periodic installments. The platform should let users enroll in these plans online, providing banking information securely and getting a schedule of upcoming withdrawals. It should also simulate the amounts (showing what each installment would be) so the user understands the commitment ([
		SAAQclic Services for Individuals](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login#:~:text=,authorized%20debits)). For certain fees like large insurance claim repayments or fines, installment options could be offered as well, subject to SAAQ policies. Internally, this requires the system to securely store bank debit authorization and integrate with an automated clearing house system to process those payments on schedule. It should adjust the user’s account status to indicate an active payment plan (so their license/registration remains valid while payments are being made). If a payment fails, the system should alert the user and allow them to rectify it, and potentially escalate if multiple payments are missed.

- **Refunds and Adjustments Management**: Include functionality to handle refunds or payment adjustments. If a user accidentally overpays, or if a service is cancelled and a refund is due (for instance, someone paid for a registration but then decided not to go through with it within an allowable window), the platform should be able to process that. Users might initiate a refund request through their account for eligible cases. The system should track the status of refund requests and show the user when the refund is issued. Internally, issuing a refund might require approval from a finance officer; the system should route these for review and then execute the refund via the original payment method when possible (or flag to issue a manual refund if outside a certain period). Additionally, if any fee adjustment is needed (like waiving a late fee due to special circumstances), an authorized employee can apply that through the system. All financial adjustments should be logged and reflected in the user’s transaction history for transparency.

- **Financial Reconciliation and Reporting**: Ensure robust back-end processes for reconciling all payments with SAAQ’s financial systems. Each day, the system should produce reconciliation reports that detail the total collected amounts per service category (licenses, registrations, fines, etc.), which can be cross-checked against the payment gateway and bank deposits. Any discrepancies should be flagged. The platform should support integration with the government’s accounting software, so that all transactions post automatically to the ledger with the correct revenue codes. It should also handle **batch processing** for external payments – for example, if banks send batches of payments (from people who paid via their bank’s bill pay), the system can import those and match them to the correct accounts. Financial officers should have access to administrative screens to correct or allocate payments that couldn’t be automatically matched. Moreover, end-of-year or end-of-month financial summaries can be generated for audit purposes, broken down by service type. All these ensure that the introduction of online transactions does not compromise the accuracy of SAAQ’s financial records and simplifies the workload of the finance department through automation.

## 8. Accessibility and Compliance

- **Compliance with Government Regulations**: The platform must adhere to all applicable Quebec and Canadian laws and regulations governing SAAQ’s operations. This includes privacy laws (ensuring personal data is protected under laws like the Act respecting Access to documents held by public bodies and the Protection of personal information), data residency requirements (hosting data in Canada as required for government data), and any specific SAAQ legislation. The system’s design and processes should align with SAAQ’s legal mandate (e.g., the Automobile Insurance Act) to ensure all digital services are delivered within the allowed scope. Regular audits and updates may be required as laws change or new directives are issued. For example, if the government mandates new identity verification standards or new reporting requirements, the platform should be flexible to accommodate these.

- **Bilingual and Multilingual Support**: The platform must be fully bilingual, providing all customer-facing content and interfaces in French and English. Given Quebec law, French should be the default language of communication, with English offered as an option for those who need it. All forms, instructions, notifications, and help content should be available in both languages, with quality translation (not just machine translation) to ensure clarity and correctness. The user should be able to toggle the interface language at any time. In addition to French and English, consider offering support for other languages commonly used by immigrants or visitors in Quebec (e.g., a simplified guide in Spanish, Arabic, Mandarin, etc., if resources allow), although official transactions would remain in the official languages. Internally, this means maintaining content in two languages in parallel – any updates to a page or notice must be reflected in both. The platform should also handle inputs in various languages where applicable (for instance, names with accents or different character sets). Compliance with the SAAQ’s language policies is critical to serve Quebec’s population effectively and lawfully.

- **Accessibility and Inclusive Design**: Design the system to meet high standards of accessibility so that all users, including those with disabilities, can use the online services. This entails compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0/2.1 AA (as required by Quebec government web standards) – for example, providing text alternatives for images, ensuring content can be navigated by keyboard only, and having sufficient color contrast for text ([The SAAQ's website and accessibility - Gouvernement du Québec](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/accessibility#:~:text=Qu%C3%A9bec%20saaq,with%20disabilities%20or%20various%20difficulties)). The interface should support screen readers by using proper semantic HTML and ARIA labels where needed. Features like resizable text, the ability to pause animations, and avoidance of content that can trigger seizures (no flashing content) should be in place. Additionally, provide captions or transcripts for any multimedia content (e.g., instructional videos). Beyond technical compliance, inclusive design means considering users with cognitive impairments or lower tech literacy: use plain language in instructions (especially in French, which should be clear and accessible), and provide error messages that are easy to understand and correct. The platform should undergo usability testing with assistive technologies and be certified as accessible. SAAQ is **committed to making its website accessible to people with disabilities**, and the new platform should reflect that commitment in practice ([The SAAQ's website and accessibility - Gouvernement du Québec](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/accessibility#:~:text=Qu%C3%A9bec%20saaq,with%20disabilities%20or%20various%20difficulties)).

- **Responsive and Mobile-Friendly**: Ensure the digital platform is mobile-responsive so that all services are accessible on various devices (desktop computers, tablets, smartphones) without loss of functionality. The layout should adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, with a mobile-friendly navigation and input methods (e.g., using appropriate keyboard on touch devices for numeric inputs like license numbers). This is crucial because many users, especially younger ones, may prefer doing these transactions on their phones. All features – whether it’s uploading a document by taking a photo with a phone, or paying a fee – should work smoothly on mobile. The design should also consider users on slower internet connections; pages should load efficiently and not consume excessive data. Internally, this means the development team should adopt a mobile-first design philosophy and test the application on common browsers and devices. Providing a consistent experience across devices will increase adoption of the online services and reduce the need for in-person visits.

- **User Privacy and Data Protection**: The platform should be built with privacy by design. Users must consent to any collection of personal data, and privacy notices should be clearly provided when they enroll or before submitting sensitive information. The system should allow users to view the personal information SAAQ holds about them (driver profile, vehicles, etc.) and request corrections if needed ([The SAAQ](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq#:~:text=The%20SAAQ%20The%20SAAQ%20is,all%20its%20fields%20of%20activity)). Any data that is displayed or printed (like digital registration certificates) should avoid exposing more personal info than necessary (e.g., not showing full SIN or license number except where needed). The system should mask or hide sensitive data from being viewed by others (for instance, if a user is displaying their info on a public computer, ensure session timeouts and masking of certain fields). Internally, privacy protection involves training for staff on proper handling of data, and technical measures like automatic logouts, encryption, and monitoring for any unauthorized data access. Compliance with privacy is not just a legal requirement but a business requirement to maintain public confidence in the digital platform.

---

By implementing these business requirements in a structured manner, the SAAQ can deliver a robust digital service platform (often referred to as **SAAQclic** for online services) that covers the full range of its services. This platform will provide Quebec residents a convenient one-stop solution for all their driver and vehicle needs, while enabling SAAQ staff to work more efficiently with integrated workflows and accurate information. The end result is a modernized SAAQ that improves customer satisfaction, reduces processing times, and upholds safety and compliance in all aspects of road use and automobile insurance in Quebec.
